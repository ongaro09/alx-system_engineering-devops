# Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## OSI Model

- **What it is:** 
  - The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework used to understand how network protocols interact and communicate over a network.

- **How many layers it has:** 
  - It has seven layers.

- **How it is organized:** 
  1. Physical Layer
  2. Data Link Layer
  3. Network Layer
  4. Transport Layer
  5. Session Layer
  6. Presentation Layer
  7. Application Layer

## LAN (Local Area Network)

- **Typical usage:** 
  - LANs are commonly used in homes, offices, schools, and other small-scale environments to connect devices within a limited geographical area.

- **Typical geographical size:** 
  - Geographically, LANs cover a relatively small area, such as a single building, campus, or group of nearby buildings.

## WAN (Wide Area Network)

- **Typical usage:** 
  - WANs are used to connect geographically dispersed LANs or other networks over long distances.

- **Typical geographical size:** 
  - WANs cover large geographical areas, often spanning cities, countries, or even continents.

## Internet

- **What is an IP address:** 
  - An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

- **What are the 2 types of IP address:** 
  - IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) and IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6).

- **What is localhost:** 
  - Localhost refers to the loopback network interface of a device, typically represented by the IP address 127.0.0.1, which allows a device to communicate with itself.

- **What is a subnet:** 
  - A subnet is a portion of a network that shares a common address component. It enables the division of a single network into smaller, manageable sections.

- **Why IPv6 was created:** 
  - IPv6 was created to address the depletion of available IPv4 addresses and to provide additional features and improvements over IPv4.

## TCP/UDP

- **What are the 2 mainly used data transfer protocols for IP:** 
  - TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

- **What is the main difference between TCP and UDP:** 
  - TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data, whereas UDP provides faster transmission but does not guarantee delivery or order.

- **What is a port:** 
  - A port is a logical construct used to identify a specific process or service on a networked device.

- **Memorize SSH, HTTP and HTTPS port numbers:** 
  - SSH: Port 22
  - HTTP: Port 80
  - HTTPS: Port 443

- **What tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network:** 
  - Ping is a common tool/protocol used to check the connectivity of a device on a network by sending ICMP echo requests and waiting for responses.
